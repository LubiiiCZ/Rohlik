Test Automation
- Automate basic flow through the web (login-adding product into basket-check basket) using
  a programming language/framework of your choice (Java + Selenium, TestNG, REST Assured, Cypress, etc.).
- Ensure your test is scalable, reusable, and follows best coding practices.
- Integrate the test into a CI/CD pipeline (you donâ€™t need to set up a real pipeline, just describe how it would be implemented).
